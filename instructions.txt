Actions and Commands I used:

1. vagrant plugin install vagrant-host-shell
2. vagrant up
3. vagrant ssh pipelines.do1.exam
4. sudo visudo -> at the bottom of the file paste "jenkins ALL=(ALL)    NOPASSWD: ALL"
5. sudo usermod -s /bin/bash jenkins
6. su - (password is vagrant) and then su - jenkins 
7. ssh-keygen -t ecdsa -b 521 -m PEM
8. in new terminal - > vagrant ssh containers.do1.exam - >  sudo useradd jenkins &&  sudo passwd jenkins - > steps from 4 to 5
10. in pipelines.do1.exam - > ssh-copy-id jenkins@containers (the password is the same one which we set via passwd)
11. Then I installed Jenkins at http://192.168.111.201:8080 providing the password outputed during the setup in 2.
12. In Manage Jenkins - > Credentials - > System - > Global Credentials - > I created a Global SSH Credential with the generated private key
13. Installed SSH and Generic Webhook Trigger plugins via Manage Jenkins - > Plugins, selecting for Jenkins to be restarted
14. Manage Jenkins ->  System -> SSH Sites -> I added the containers host selecting the SSH credentials I set up in 12
15. Manage Jenkins - > Manage Nodes and Clouds- > New Node - after setting up the label (docker-node) for the node - > selected Only build jobs with label expression matching this node ; Set Launch method to Launch agents via SSH and select the Global SSH Credential 
16. I went to http://192.168.111.202:3000 and installed Gitea
17. Then I made an empty repo called supercalc
18. I copied the run_gitea.sh to the supercalc container and I executed it effectively pushing the supercalc application to the Gitea repo
19. I created a new Jenkins Pipeline. In the Configure set:

In GitHub Project set the Gitea  URL
Build Triggers - > GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling
Build Triggers - > Poll SCM 
Build Triggers - > Generic Webhook Trigger

In the Pipeline script I used the content of the Jenkinsfile

20. In the Gitea repo - > Settings - > Webhook I set the Webhook from the Pipeline's Generic Webhook Trigger
